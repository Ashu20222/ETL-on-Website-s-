## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Project with Python Pandas and BeautifulSoup

This is a Python project for performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on data from multiple sources using Python Pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries. The project extracts data from various sources using web scraping, applies transformations to the data, and loads it into a target destination.
## Overview 

The ETL process is an important component of data integration and is commonly used in data warehousing, business intelligence, and data analysis projects. This project provides a framework for performing ETL operations on data from various sources using Python Pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries.

The project can be customized to work with different types of data and can be extended to include additional sources or destinations.
## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the project:

pandas

BeautifulSoup

You can install them by running the following command:

> pip install pandas 

> pip install beautifulsoup4


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Customize the file to work with your specific data sources and target destination.

4. Run the script using the command python filename.
5. The script will extract data from the specified sources using web scraping, apply transformations to the data using Python Pandas and BeautifulSoup libraries, and load it into the target destination.
## Output

The output of the ETL process will depend on the specific data sources and target destination used in the project. Typically, the output will be stored in a database or file system, such as a CSV or Excel file.


## Acknowledgments

1. This project was inspired by the need to integrate data from multiple sources into a centralized location for analysis and reporting.

2. The pandas library was used for data manipulation and analysis.

3. The BeautifulSoup library was used for web scraping data.
